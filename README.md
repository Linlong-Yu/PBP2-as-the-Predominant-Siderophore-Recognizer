# README

## Overview
This repository contains all scripts, data, and intermediate results used for the analyses presented in the manuscript:  
**“Co-Evolutionary Characterization of PBP2 as the Predominant Siderophore Recognizer in Diverse Gram-Positive Bacteria”**  
(https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.09.29.679136v2.article-info)

The analyses were primarily performed using **MATLAB** (R2024a, though the code is compatible with other recent versions) and **R** (version 4.3.2).  
Required R packages are listed in the corresponding scripts.

## Folder Structure

- **Figure1–Figure4/**  
  Each folder corresponds to a main figure in the manuscript.  
  Input data are stored in the `/input` subfolder (some large files are compressed).  
  Scripts are located in `/Scripts`, and intermediate results are stored in `/output`.

- **Supplement/**  
  Contains scripts used to generate **Figure S1–S2** and **Table S1–S2**.  
  Each subfolder includes a detailed README describing the corresponding data and analysis steps.

## Notes
- All data files and analysis scripts are self-contained and fully reproducible.  
- Some large datasets have been compressed to reduce repository size.
