## Input Files

- **genus_gbk_summary.csv**  
  Extracted from antiSMASH results, recording the total number of secondary metabolite regions predicted for each strain (i.e., the number of predicted regions).

- **genus_info.csv**  
  Contains genus information for each strain, as well as the complete list of strain names analyzed from RefSeq.

- **RAxML_result.GCF_data_refined.tre**  
  Phylogenetic tree computed using **PhyloPhlAn**, representing evolutionary distances among different strains.

- **summ_genus.csv**  
  Contains information about each siderophore BGC.

- **syn_info_5_genera.csv**  
  Core biosynthetic genes were extracted from siderophore BGCs (as annotated by antiSMASH) to represent each siderophoreâ€™s synthetase genes.  
  Sequence distances among these biosynthetic genes were calculated, followed by hierarchical clustering to group siderophores.  
  For siderophore groups with sizes greater than 3 (in *Rhodococcus* and *Corynebacterium*) or greater than 5 (in *Streptomyces*, *Staphylococcus*, and *Bacillus*), product annotations were assigned by comparing with the **MIBiG** database.

## Scripts

- **phylogenetic_tree_total_5_genera.R**  
  Plots the phylogenetic tree of 5,940 strains.

- **SecondMetabolity_siderophorenumber.R**  
  Calculates the proportion of siderophores and secondary metabolites within each genus.

- **knowncluster.R**  
  Analyzes the similarity of siderophore BGCs to known BGCs in the **MIBiG** database.

- **sider_relative_abundance.R**  
  Computes the relative abundance of siderophore BGCs across genera.
